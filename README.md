Hatchways Frontend Assessment: Create Student Profiles.

##About
This is a front end coding challenge completed in one day. The content was built to a given design specification.

##Getting Started

Clone the repo to your machine.
run "npm install" in the client folder.
then run "npm start".

##Technologies

JavaScript - React
I used Hooks instead of class components because I wanted more practice with useState and useEffect. If this application handled more data I might use Redux for state management.

Modular CSS & CSS FlexBox
I used Modular CSS for locally scoped styles, and CSS FlexBox for visually appealing formatting.
